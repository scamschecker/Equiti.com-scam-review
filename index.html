    </p>
    <p>
      Although <strong>Equiti.com</strong> may appear to be a legitimate brokerage, there are increasing reports from clients who have experienced suspicious account behavior, unexplained fees, and withheld withdrawals.
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
      ⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> Several users have reported poor customer support, slippage manipulation, and frozen funds. While Equiti.com claims regulation, users are encouraged to verify licensing independently and exercise caution before investing.

    <h2>Is Equiti.com a Scam or Legit?</h2>
    <p>
      Equiti.com operates in multiple jurisdictions and claims to have regulatory licenses. However, the number of complaints online has raised concerns about their legitimacy, especially among retail traders. Transparency and fair dealing seem inconsistent.
